description=Lifemapper Species Distribution Modeling (LmSDM) and presence absence based Range and Diversity macroecology tools (LmRAD). LmRAD supports phylogenetic trees for linking statistics to Range/Diversity plots. (Release notes for version on github) Supported by US NSF Grants:  BIO/DBI #0851290, EHR/DRL #0918590, BIO/DEB #1208472 
category=Web
version=version 2.2.1 
about=Plugin for Lifemapper webservices for SDM modeling, and multispecies Presence Absence Matrix (PAM) analysis.
	The tool allows you to build SDM models using GBIF, iDigBio, or user supplied species occurrence data. A Lifemapper Archive Browser
	allows you to search the Lifemapper Archive for SDM projections and occurrence sets data through a hint service.  You can
	use the browser by clicking the Lifemapper icon, you do not have to be logged in. Environmental layers can be uploaded and 
	compiled into Environmental layer sets to model SDMs.  PAM analysis can be driven by whole folders of species data organized
	by taxa, or phylogenetic trees.  Trees can be supplied by the user, or browsed and used from Open Tree of Life.  
	An extensive help system for each step in the workflow is supplied in each dialog.
