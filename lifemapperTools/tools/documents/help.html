       <h1>Lifemapper Tool</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the <a href="http://Lifemapper.org">Lifemapper</a> Lifemapper LmRAD and SDM tool.  This tool
        allows you to build Lifemapper species distribution models (SDM) using climate models and range and diversity experiments (LmRAD), with presence absence matrices (PAM) for large geographic
        extents with thousands of species distribution layers. This tools uses the <a href="http://Lifemapper.org">Lifemapper</a> suite
        of web services. You must have an internet connection and you must have a Lifemapper account, see <a href="#signUp">Sign Up</a> 
        to get an account.  Terms used in this help system are:
        <ul>
        <li> <a href="http://Lifemapper.org">Lifemapper</a> - Lifemapper combines species occurrence data with global climate, terrain and land 
        cover information, to identify environmental correlates of species ranges. 
        </li>
        <li> PAM - Presence Absence Matrix - a binary matrix denoting the presence or absence of a species in a set of geographic sites, the matrix
        is two dimensional with the Y axis representing all of the sites in a study grid.  The X axis represents one species range per column. 
        </li>
        <li> SDM - Spatial Distribution Model
        </li>
        <li> Layer - A species range, either a shapefile or GeoTIFF
        </li>
        <li> Grid - A uniformly spaced grid of regular polygons with each polygon representing a 'site' 
        </ul> 
        There are sample species layers in the LifemapperTools/sampledata directory with this plugin.  A short tutorial
        demonstrating how to use this tool with the sample data is available here: <a href="http://Lifemapper.org/help/qgisTutorial.html">Tutorial</a>

       		To start a new range and diversity experiment go to the 'Range and Diversity' menu item from the Lifemapper plugin menu
       		and click 'New Experiment'. If you are currently working on an experiment 
       		and start a new one, your current experiment will be saved as a QGIS project, and 
       		new QGIS project started.
       		</p>
       		<p>  
       		1.) Enter a name for your experiment.This name will help you find your experiment in
       		the experiment listing dialog. Each of your experiments will also be given a unique id by
       		the system.
       		</p>
       		<p>
       		2.) Define a geographic projection for your experiment.
       		The system uses the EPSG code for the required projection information.  You can choose
       		this easily by clicking the small button next to the projection field which opens a
       		Coordinate Reference System Selector.  By choosing a projection and clicking okay, the
       		EPSG code is automatically set. If you know your EPSG you can also enter it manually.
       		</p>
       		<p>
       		<b> Note: All the species layers that you add to an experiment
       		must be in the same projection as your experiment.</b>

       		<p> There is an optional field for an email address, where you will be emailed upon
       		the completion of jobs on your experiments.
       		</p>
       		<p>
       		3.) There are four options that can be chosen before clicking 'OK'.  Choosing one of these
       		options determines the next step that you will be taken to after your experiment is initialized.

       <h2><a name="listgrids">Get Grids</a></h2>
	       <p>
	       The Get Grids Dialog lists the grids for an experiment and provides information about your grids.
	       Most of the work in a LmRAD experiment is done against the grid. Selecting a grid here will activate a
	       'Current Grid' menu item in the Lifemapper plugin menu allowing direct access to statitics if you have
	       done a calculate, see below. For each grid in the grid table there is a field called 'Retrieve Grid',
	       clicking on a link in that field will download your grid and if there is a PAM  will attached the presence
	       absence information to your shapefile.  There are five operations available for each grid from this dialog.
	       You must select a grid in the table before performing an operation on it.
	       </p>
	       <ul>
	         <li>Intersect</li>
	       	<p>
	       	   Intersects a grid against all of the layers uploaded using the <a href="#uploadLayers">Add Layers</a> or Add SDM Layers
	       	   dialogs.  Intersecting the grid produces a presence absence matrix (PAM) and set of statistics on the grid. To use: Click 'Intersect', the dialog
	       	   will change to an output view with a progress bar.  This is asynchronous service call, if the job takes too long, a status
	       	   message will pop up indicating that your job will be available later. If the job completes within a few seconds 
	       	   the output dialog will that will automatically add the map to your QGIS canvas.
	       	<p>
	       	   The Grid can show several different stages and statuses as work is done on it.  Mainly, though a complete status means just that.
	       	   The "calculated" status is the final stage, and shows that your PAM is ready.
	       	</p>
	       	<p>  
	       	  The following statistics are automatically calculated on the PAM and can be accessed from the

	       	   intersected. Randomization is optional, statistics and operations can be performed on just 
	       	   the original non-randomized PAM. Randomization will allow you to compare stats across null models

       <h2><a name="uploadLayers">Add Local Layers</a></h2>
	       <p>
	           The Add Layers or Upload presence/absence layers dialog is an upload dialog for
	           adding presence absence vector (shapefiles only) or raster (GeoTIFF only) layers to your experiment.
	           Each layer should represent the range or distribution for <b>one</b> species. 
	           You can upload hundreds or more layers at a time, and the dialog allows you to
	           easily set parameter on all of the them at the same time.
	       </p>   
	       <p><b>Adding new layers to an experiment 
	           that already as a PAM, i.e. has already been intersected, removes the old PAM from the Lifemapper 
	           system and reinitializes your experiment, so that you will have to do a new intersect to 
	           build a new set of PAM's.</b> 
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       1.) First use the 'Browse' button to browse your file system for your layers, the file dialog will automatically filter
	       on .tif or .shp extensions.  Select as many files as you want in the file dialog.  If all of your 
	       files are not in one directory you can add files from one directory, add those layers and then click 'Browse' again to 
	       add more layers from other directories.  You can also remove layers if you mistakenly add layers that you don't like.
	       Your selected layers will be added to the upload table.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       2.)  Notice that there are fields that you must fill out for each layer to upload presence absence species layers. 
	       All cells that have been populated with a value have a right click context menu that allows you set values in column
	       mode for all the records. One approach is to populate the cells in the first record, and then right click on the set
	       values and set the column across hundreds of records. The context menu for the column mode allows you to set all cells
	       in a column, just selected rows, or just records that are empty.  The fields that you must set are as follows:
	       </p>
	        <ul>
	       	   <li>Layer Name</li>
		       	   <p>
		       	   Layer names are editable in the table, these are the names as they will appear in your experiment. By default the filename
	               is used. 
		       	   </p>
	       	   <li>Presence Attribute</li>
	       	      <p>
	       	       The Presence Attribute is the field in the shapefile that denotes presence, it has to be a numerical field.
	       	       Double clicking on a cell in the Presence Attribute column populates a drop down list with the names of all
	       	       the fields in the shapefile, choose the field that holds the presence information.  In the case of GeoTIFF's this field
	       	       will be automatically populated with 'pixel', you will not be able to edit it. 
	       	      </p>
	       	   <li>Minimum Presence</li>
	       	   	<p>
	       	       Minimum Presence is the minimum vale of the data in the Presence Absence Attribute field that denotes presence.
	       	       If your layers is a GeoTIFF, this value is the pixel value for presence.
	       	      </p>
	       	   <li>Maximum Presence</li>
	       	      <p>
	       	       Maximum Presence is the maximum value of the data in the Presence Absence Attribute that denotes presence.
	       	      </p>
	       
	       	   <li>Percent Presence</li>
	       	      <p>
	       	      Percent Presence is the percentage of a cell in your grid that must intersect with a feature or pixels from the 
	       	      vector or raster species layer (presence/absence layer) to constitute presence, e.g. 12 in the Percent Presence, 
	       	      and 1 in min presence, and 2 max presence means that a cell in the grid must have 12 percent of its area overlapped
	       	      with polygons that have 1 >= and <= 2 in its Presence Attribute.
	       	      </p>
	       	</ul> 
	       	<p>
	       	3.) After you are finished adding layers and setting their parameters, Click the "Add to Experiment" button underneath 
	       	the upload table. A progress bar will indicate the progress of your upload. 
	       
       <h2><a name="addSDMLayer">Add Lifemapper SDM Layers</a></h2>
   
	       <p>
	           The  Add Lifemapper SDM Layers dialog allows you to browse the <a href="http://Lifemapper.org/signup">Lifemapper</a> Spatial Distribution Models
	           archive an add species distribution layers based on future and present climate scenarios to your LmRAD
	           experiment.  <b>Adding new layers to an experiment that already has a PAM, i.e. has already been intersected, removes
	           the old PAM from the Lifemapper system and reinitializes your experiment, so that you will have to do a new intersect to 
	           build a new set of PAM's.</b>
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       1.) First search for modeled distribution layers using the controls in the "Search for Species" box.  Pick
	       an algorithm code, a climate scenario and then enter a species name (Case Sensitive) in the text box. Next
	       click "Search"  if there are distribution layers in our archive or for your user that match your criterion then the "Search Results"
	       table will be populated with those layers.  Each match will have a record, notice that you can preview
	       the layers by clicking the link in the preview column.  This adds a WMS layer of that layer to your map canvas.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       2.) When you have a found a layer or layers that you would like to add to your experiment, add them to the 
	       "Layers to add to experiment" table by using the "+" button.  You can remove layers from the "Layers to add
	       to experiment" table by selecting a layer and using the "-" button.  You can continue to search for others layers
	       as many times as you want in the search dialog and continue to add layers to the table.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       3.) The same parameters must be filled out for each layer in the same way as the <a href="#uploadLayers">Add Local Layers</a> Dialog.
	       These are raster layers in the <a href="http://Lifemapper.org/signup">Lifemapper</a> system, so the "Presence
	       Attribute" field will be set automatically for you.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       4.) Be sure to set the "Min Presence", "Max Presence" and "% Presence" columns for each layer. You can do 
	       this easily by setting an entire column by right clicking a value and using the right click menu to set
	       all the values in a column, for all layers, all selected layers or empty cells.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       5.) Click the "Add to Experiment" button to add the layers to your experiment.
	       </p>
	       
	       
       
       <h2><a name="constructGrid">Construct Grid</a></h2>
          <p>
          The Construct Grid dialog builds a regularly spaced grid of regular polygons that defines the cells (sites) in the PAM, for any given 
          spatial extent.  This dialog allows you to set the spatial extent and resolution (cell size) of the 
          cells and choose either regular hexagons or squares.  You can add many different grids to the same 
          experiment and they will share the presence absence species layers from the experiment.  This will allow
          you to test changes in diversity statistics at different resolutions. The Construct Grid dialog can be used

	       1.) Start by defining an extent.  The extent can be entered manually using the 'Enter Coords' radio button
	       and filling out the Min X, Min Y, Max X, Max Y coordinate fields in the map units of the projection choosen
	       when you initialized the experiment. A mask can be used to provide the coordinates and will cookie cutter
	       the resulting grid.  To do this choose the 'Use selected feature' radio button, a polygon shapefile must be 
	       present and active in your table of contents, also a single feature must be selected that you wish to use
	       to build your grid. When using a mask the coordinate fields will be automatically populated.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       2.) Choose a cell shape from the available options.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       3.) The EPSG Code and Map Units will already be filled out with the projection information provided when 
	       the experiment was initialized. 
          </p>
          <p>
          4.) Define a cell size <b>in the map units for your projection</b>.  For hexagons
          this represents diameter from vertex to vertex. 
          </p>
          <p>
          5.) Give the grid a name e.g. Brazil_1_Degree, that will be used by you for identification. The grid will also be
          given a unique id in the <a href="http://Lifemapper.org">Lifemapper</a> system upon construction.
          </p>
          <p>
          6.) Double check all of your entries
          </p>
          <p>
          7.) Click 'OK'.  Clicking 'OK' sends a request to the <a href="http://Lifemapper.org">Lifemapper</a> web services to build a grid and enter its
          data into the data base for your user.  A progress bar will indicate the progress of the construction. When it 
          is done the grid will be added to your map as a layer.
          
     <h2><a name="randomizePAM">Randomize PAM</a></h2>  
         <p>
         This dialog helps you to create null models by producing randomized versions of you presence absence matrix. There
         are two options for randomization "Swap" based on the checkerboard swap algorithm of Gotelli, N. J, that keeps the marginal
         totals of your PAM intact.  And Dye-Dispersion which rearranges species ranges according to a "Dye-Dispersion" algorithm. With 
         this algorithm the range size for a species will remain the same but will seek out contiguous patterns across different 
         cells in the grid similar to a geographic constraints model.
         </p>
         <p>
         With the swap algorithm you will be asked to provide a number of iterations with which to search the PAM for suitable
         swaps, a good rule of thumb is the number of cells in the PAM squared. 
         </p>
         <p>
         You can produce as many randomized PAM's as wish in an experiment.
         </p>
         
       
     <h2><a name="statistics">Statistics</a></h2>
	       
	       <p>
	       1.) The Statistics dialog has a drop down list that is populated when you choose a set of PAMs to view from the radio
	       buttons labeled 'original and randomized PAMs'.  Choose a set of PAMs from the radion buttons, 'All PAMs', 
	       'Swapped PAMs', 'Dye-dispersion PAMs' and then choose 'All' or an individual PAM from the drop down list
	       the radio buttons. This will activate the 'Statistics' radio buttons and drop down list on the right side of the dialog.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       2.) Choose a type of statistic from the 'Statistics' radio button, 'Site based', 'Species based', or 'Diversity Beta's'.
	       This will populate the drop down list with individual statistics and a choice for all statistics of the type chosen
	       with the radio button.
	       </p>
	       <p> 
	       3.) Once PAMs and statistics are chosen, you can then view them in a table by clicking the 'View in table' button.
	       Your table will appear below the controls. Choosing a new combination of PAMs or stats will regenerate the table.
	       Once a table is generated, the 'Scatter Plot' button becomes enabled, and if your stats are site-based, the 
	       'Spatially View' button will become enabled.
	       </p>
	       <p>
	       4.) If you want to view a scatter plot, select two vectors of data, by selecting two columns by clicking once
	       anywhere on the data in the column, hold down the Ctrl key and select another column.  These will be the two
	       data vectors plotted in the scatter plot.  Click the 'Scatter Plot' button and a scatter plot will be generated
	       and shown in a seperate plot dialog. The plot dialog has a button that allows you to easily switch the axis. 
          </p>
          <p>
          5.) Clicking the 'Spatially View' button opens up the <a href="#spatialview">Spatial View</a> Download dialog.
          
    <h2><a name="spatialview">Spatially View</a></h2>
    		<p>
    		The Spatially View dialog is essentially a download dialog. This dialog will allow you to download
    		your grid with the site-based statistics attached as attributes in the shapefile. The statistics that
    		will be attached, are listed on the right side of the dialog.  A set of radio buttons allows you
    		to do an auto-classify on a particular statistic on download, but note that you will get all of the
    		statistics as different fields in the shapefile and can reclassify on those data.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    		1.) Select a PAM grid to download.
         </p>
         <p>
